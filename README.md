purneshtripathi.me
==================

The repository has been created to monitor all the changes that I do in my portfolio. I recently received http://purneshtripathi.me as my portfolio domain name under the Github Student Developer pack along with a lot of other things. 

So, I decided to develop a nice application for it. I am using Helios HTML5 template from HTML5up.net for the front end and CodeIgniter framework, which is based on PHP, for the back end.
