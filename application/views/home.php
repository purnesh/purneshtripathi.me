							<p>
								At times, I like to blog. Although, there have been very few posts in the last two years, but still I find it better to be an infrequent blogger, than not being one at all!

								<h3><a href="#">Music Lover</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								There are times when I need absolute peace, that is something I look for, in music. I like listening to soft rock and semi-classical music genres. On another note, I am also learning to play flute.

								<h3><a href="#">Thinker</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								When I am doing nothing, I like to think. Due to this habit that I had engendered at a very early age, I sometimes find it very difficult to rest. I think on varying topics starting from politics, social issues to the next generation of human race etc. :)
